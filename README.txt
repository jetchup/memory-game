# README

This is a typical memory game. You have to find pairs of cards, and remember the location of the cards that don't match. When you find all of the pairs, you win the game.

The HTML is divided in two main parts: 
* container houses all the game info: Name of the game, time elapsed, restart button, and star rating.
* card-deck is where the cards are located. 

You will get a congratulations message when you finish the game, showing you how long you took to finish it and your star rating. 

The game is fully functional, but lacks pretty details like 
- [ ] Animation when you match cards
- [ ] Animation when you don't match cards
- [ ] Animation when you win the game

Have fun playing!
